                Welcome to my to-do list for this website.<br>
                Things that are in <i>italics</i> are high priority and will be added before other features on the list.<br>
               Things in <span class='strike'>strikethrough</span> have in theory, been fixed.
            </p>

            <p class = "description">Currently in progress items, in no particular order:</p>
            <hr class="sep">
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to edit and delete your own content. This is proving to be tricky, so it may take time.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix things wrong with the edit page, listed below:</li>
                    <li class='strike'>Fix HTML characters displaying in the textboxes. They should be new line characters.</li>
                    <li>Fix the textboxes not expanding to fit the text that's in them on the edit page</li>
                </ul>
                <li class='strike'>Fix the login info not updating once logged in.</li>

                <li>Rework the weapon entry page</li>
                <li>Rework the Ability / Power / Spell entry page.</li>
                <li><i>The ability to upload pictures for appearance (and more). Ideally multiple pictures if desired.</i></li>
                <li>Have checking the favourite box in character settings actually do something. Like.. I dunno, show a star by the character.</li>
                <li>Create the item, weapon and spell display pages.</li>
                <li>A proper page for administrative actions. It exists, but is empty right now.</li>
                <li><i>Password reset functionality.</i> The only reason an email is required. Otherwise if you forget your password, you'd be screwed.</li>
                <li>Exportable data. Perhaps in a downloadable XML or JSON format. (this one will be one of the last features to implement.</li>
