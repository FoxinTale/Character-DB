        <p>To do list</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add options to the "Browser Customization". This will  allow users to customize the background image and colours.</li>
            <li>Fix all issues with Browser Ponies, listed on "Known Issues".</li>
            <li>Get the forms and data entry functional. This is much easier said than done.</li>
            <li>Get login and account creation working. Do this before character data entry is complete.</li>
            <li>Add the source for Browser Ponies to the "credits" page. That was not made by me, so give credit.</li>
            <li>Once all issues are fixed and the features are added, remove this and the issues page.</li>
        </ul>
