# Character-DB

A character database I made to store character information for folks to use.

As a note, Browser Ponies and Javascript based snow was not coded by me. Refer to credits.php to see who did.
W3.css, initially was also not written by me, but I've added items more secific to the site over time.
So, it's half/half now.
Th rest of this however, was me. 


### The mobile rewrite.
Just as it says, it's a total rewrite of the entire site.
#### What changed? 
- Included usage of W3.css for a more mobile friendly website.
- Rewrote the pages to use w3.css instead of their own css files.
- Overhauled and rewrote the navigation menu to be mobile friendly.
- Rewrote the display tabs and accordions to not use jQuery, and as much CSS as possible.
- Purged a lot of <div> tags, replacing them with more proper elements wherever possible.
- Changed the entire information display methodology, replacing readonly inputs with <p> or <span> tags wherever possible.
- Temporarily removed the funstuff page while it undergoes extensive maintenance and its own overhaul.
- Removed the mechanism that allowed one to fill empty blank spots with "N/A", as it didn't really work in the first place.
- Utilized more of the custom fonts that were put in initially. 
 
 ## To do List:
 - Add back in the "funstuff" page, once it is working. 
 - Make a forum so users cna chat with each other. 
 - For the rest, reer to 'todo.php'.
