                <li>The resources page has links to various off site character generators. As well as general RP tips and advice.</li>
                <li>Fun Stuff is fun things you can do on the site, and customization.</li>
                <li>The To Do page is a list of items and things I am working on adding.<li>
                <li>Finally, the logout page does just that. Logs you out of the page.</li>
                <li>Oh, and this somewhat works on mobile devices. It's far from pretty, but it still works as a site.</li>
